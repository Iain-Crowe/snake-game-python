# Snake Game in Python

## Overview
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body. I built this project in order to utilize the Entity, Component, System (ECS) paradigm for bulding games.

- Classic snake gameplay
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows
- Score tracking
- Simple and intuitive controls

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library
